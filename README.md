## Install dependencies
It is necessary to have nodejs and angular-cli installed to be able to install and run this project:
  * Download nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * Install angular-cli by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Running application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to visualize the webpage running.

## For Chrome users

If running the application with chrome the webpage may have problems getting the data from the api. The [Moesif CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en) extension can solve this problem. You just need to add it to chrome and turn it on.
